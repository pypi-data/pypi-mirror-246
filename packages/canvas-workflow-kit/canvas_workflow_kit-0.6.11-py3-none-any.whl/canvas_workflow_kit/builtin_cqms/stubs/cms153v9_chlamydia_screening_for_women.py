    Chlamydia Screening for Women

    Description: Percentage of women 16-24 years of age who were identified as sexually active and
    who had at least one test for chlamydia during the measurement period

    Definition: None

    Rationale: Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection in
    the U.S., resulting in roughly 1.7 million cases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
    2018). Chlamydia infections are often asymptomatic, but, if left untreated, can lead to serious
    and irreversible complications (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2014; Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention, 2018).

    Women are particularly vulnerable when infected with chlamydia. Left untreated, chlamydia can
    cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to chronic pelvic pain or infertility.
    Pregnant women may also transmit the infection to their infant, potentially resulting in
    neonatal pneumonia (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018).

    Guidance: Codes to identify sexually active women include codes for: pregnancy, sexually
    transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices, and infertility treatments.

    The denominator exclusion does not apply to patients who qualify for the initial population
    (IP) based on services other than the pregnancy test alone. These other services include
    services for sexually transmitted infections, contraceptives or contraceptive devices and
    infertility treatments. For example, a patient who has both a pregnancy test and a chlamydia
    diagnosis, either of which would qualify them for the IP, would not be eligible for this
    denominator exclusion.

    Patient self-report for procedures as well as diagnostic studies should be recorded in
    'Procedure, Performed' template or 'Diagnostic Study, Performed' template in QRDA-1. Patient
    self-report is not allowed for laboratory tests.

    This eCQM is a patient-based measure.

    This version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.5.  Please refer to the eCQI resource center
    (https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm) for more information on the QDM.
