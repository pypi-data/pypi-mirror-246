DataLab User Guide
==================

DataLab is a **generic signal and image processing software**
with unique features designed to meet industrial requirements
(see :ref:`key_strengths`: Extensibility, Interoperability, ...).
It is based on Python scientific libraries (such as NumPy,
SciPy or scikit-image) and Qt graphical user interfaces (thanks to
the powerful `PlotPyStack`_ - mostly the `guidata`_ and `PlotPy`_ libraries).

With its user-friendly experience and versatile :ref:`usage_modes`,
DataLab enables efficient development of your data processing and
visualization applications while benefiting from an industrial-grade
technological platform.

    Signal and image visualization in DataLab

DataLab :ref:`main_features` are available not only using the
**stand-alone application**
(easily installed thanks to the Windows installer or the Python package)
but also by **embedding it into your own application**
(see the "embedded tests" for detailed examples of how to do so).

    DataLab is powered by `PlotPyStack <https://github.com/PlotPyStack>`_,
    the scientific Python-Qt visualization and graphical user interface stack.

.. note:: DataLab was created by `Codra`_/`Pierre Raybaut`_ in 2023. It is
          developed and maintained by DataLab open-source project team with
          the support of `Codra`_.
