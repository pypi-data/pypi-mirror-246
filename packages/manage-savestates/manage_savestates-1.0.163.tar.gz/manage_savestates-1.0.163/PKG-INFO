# manage-savestates
Organizes and labels files. Designed to be used with savestates and macros generated using [gz](https://github.com/glankk/gz), also known as "the practice ROM" for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time speedrunning.

Should also work with files made using [kz](https://github.com/krimtonz/kz) (The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask equivalent) but this is untested.
