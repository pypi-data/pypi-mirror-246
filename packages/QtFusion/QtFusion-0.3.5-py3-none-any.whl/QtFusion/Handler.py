"""
This package provides classes for handling media feeds and image files, facilitating the processing and analysis of
video streams and images. It includes classes for managing video feeds from cameras or video files and for processing
individual image files. The package leverages the capabilities of OpenCV and PySide6 to handle media data efficiently
and interactively.

Classes:
- MediaHandler: Handles media feeds, such as video files or live camera streams, providing functionalities like
  starting/stopping the feed, frame processing, and emitting signals for various media events.
- ImageHandler: Manages and processes image files, emitting signals to communicate the progress and results of the
  image processing tasks.

    MediaHandler is responsible for handling media feeds, such as video files or live camera streams. It provides

    events. The class supports frame processing, where each frame captured from the media can be processed using
    user-defined functions.
