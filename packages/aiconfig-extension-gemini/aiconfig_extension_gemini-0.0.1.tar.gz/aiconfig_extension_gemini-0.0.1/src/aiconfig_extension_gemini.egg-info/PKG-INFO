# Using LLama-Guarde for model parsing with AIConfig

We are prioritizing the Python library Usage

### Part 1: Update and test this extention

If you are not testing locally (just using the published extension), ignore this and go to Part 2

1. From the `aiconfig/HuggingFaceTransformers`, run this command: `pip install build && cd python && python -m build && pip install dist/*.whl`
2. After you're done testing, be sure to delete the generated folder(s) in the `aiconfig/HuggingFaceTransformers` dir. It'll probalby look something like `python/dist` and `python/<package_name>.egg-info`

### Part 2: Importing and using this extension

1. Import whatever outputs pip gives from last command. For now it's `import text-generation` but this may change in the future
2. In code, add all the relevant model parsers that you want to use from this extension to the registry: `ModelParserRegistry.register_model_parser(HuggingFaceTextGenerationTransformer())`. You can read the docstrings under `ModelParserRegistry` class for more info
