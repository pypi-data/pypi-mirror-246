Tattler -- enterprise notification system
===========================================

Overview
--------

Tattler is an enterprise notification system.

When you want to send beautiful, branded notifications to your users, potentially
across multiple vectors like email and SMS -- Tattler does the heavy lifting for you:

- Personalize notifications to each user with templates.
- Compose compatible HTML emails with text fallback.
- Look up user contacts to deliver email or SMS.
- Tag notifications with unique IDs to aid Support teams.
- Trigger notifications from any system with a HTTP POST that solely mentions recipient and event to notify.

... so you can focus on your customer journey and brand.

Introducing Tattler usually simplifies a lot of code, and consolidates communication
to your users making it easier to manage and improve.

Your product managers will love having a trivial process to organize communication across the
customer journey, and the resulting visibility.

Your template designers will love the flexibility and ability to care of user-visible content
without distractions.

Your devs will love the massive simplification in their code for triggering notifications.

Your support team will love having access to all notifications sent to users,
and its trivial root-cause analysis across many systems.

Your sys admins will love having one single point of exit for user notifications, and the
ability to trigger notifications across different containers or even servers.


Advanced features
-----------------

Additionally, Tattler supports some advanced deployment scenarios:

- Deploy containerized components, that only communicate via TCP.
- Deliver notifications from multiple components, even if on different servers (billing, web application, batch processes etc)
- Tokenize contact information, so components only deal with user IDs, and Tattler expands the associated user information.
- Collect additional variables about a user in one place (free/paid, resources used, ...), and make it available to notifications from all subsystems.
- Insulate notification system from other systems.
- Restrict access to your users' contact data in your database to Tattler only, preventing data leaks in case of a hack.
