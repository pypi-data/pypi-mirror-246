        Is important to use physical addresses (non-secure) in settings of OTFAD to proper run the decryption on device.
        For example:
          In case of using FlexSPI2 the secure base address address is 0x1400_0000. But in setting of the OTFAD use 0x0400_0000 as a base address.
          The code must be still linked on secure base address 0x1400_0000 to proper run of OTFAD hardware.

          Same is for FlexSPI1, but instead of 0x3800_0000 base address, the 0x2800_0000 must be used in OTFAD configuration.

        The fuse word 0x47 on address 0xC70 uses error-correcting codes.
        The fuse word can only be written one time, so you must set all of the desired bits within the word at the same time.
        Refer to the SRM to get familiar with the functionality of all bitfields.
        The ENCRYPT_XIP_EN fuse is part of the BOOT_CFG1 fuse. If this bit is set, all BOOT_CFG fuses must be configured accordingly.
        The encrypted XiP can be also enabled by the BOOT_CFG pin

        It is recommended to set the USER_KEY5_RLOCK and OTFAD1/2_KEY_SEL_LOCK fuses for production to protect sensitive data stored in the USER_KEY5 fuse (if used) and to prevent a modification of the OTFAD key selection by malicious software.

        the output folder will be ignored and the full path from filename will be used.

        When using OTFAD XIP, the core clock must operate at a higher frequency than the FlexSPI clock
        otherwise, OTFAD operation may become unreliable.
