- Install the package via your IDE.

## Features

#### Testing

1. The user is able to define test cases inside a child class of the SnoTestSuite class.
2. The user is able to run all test cases with a single command:
   1. this command shows if the test suite succeeded.
3. The user is able to see the test case results after each run:
   1. these results show if a test case failed.
   2. these results show why a test case failed.
   3. these results will reset before each run.
4. The user is able to define a test suite setup:
   1. this setup is optional.
   2. this setup can be run independently of the test cases.
   3. this setup will be triggered automatically when the test suite is run.
   4. if this setup fails, the test cases will not be run.
5. The user is able to define a test suite teardown:
   1. this teardown is optional.
   2. this teardown can be run independently of the test cases.
   3. this teardown will be triggered automatically when the test suite is run.
6. The user is able to define a test case setup:
   1. this setup is optional.
   2. this setup can be run independently of the test cases.
   3. this setup will be triggered automatically before each test case.
   4. if not successful, this setup will show its results under the respective test case.
7. The user is able to define a test case teardown:
   1. this teardown is optional.
   2. this teardown can be run independently of the test cases.
   3. this teardown will be triggered automatically after each test case.
   4. if not successful, this teardown will show its results under the respective test case.

## Usage

#### Testing

1. Define a child class from the SnoTestSuite parent class located in the 'testing' module.
2. In this class, define your test cases.
3. Optionally, define test suite or test case setups and teardowns.
4. Run the child class method 'run_test_suite' to run the test suite and see if it succeeded.
5. Get detailed results from the child class 'results' attribute.
