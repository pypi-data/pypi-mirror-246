## crispy [![Test crispy](https://github.com/fybx/crispy/actions/workflows/flow-test_crispy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/fybx/crispy/actions/workflows/flow-test_crispy.yml) [![Upload Python Package](https://github.com/fybx/crispy/actions/workflows/flow-publish_package.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/fybx/crispy/actions/workflows/flow-publish_package.yml)

`crispy` is my take on parsing command-line arguments. It is a dead simple tool that allows you to define your own keys for systematically gathering variables.

In just 5 simple steps, you can start parsing any complicated user input into a dictionary—simple and predictable. It can't get more versatile than that, can it?

### Capabilities

| Feature                                                     | Support | Version     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| String, integer, float, and boolean type arguments          | ✅      | [v1.0.0][1] |
| Custom exceptions for tracking user errors in input         | ✅      | [v1.0.0][1] |
| Custom subcommands                                          | ✅      | [v2.0.0][2]  |
| Treating quoted strings as single input in `parse_string()` | TO DO   | ...         |

### Usage

1. To start using `crispy-parser` in your projects, install it from [PyPI][0]:

```shell
$ pip install crispy-parser
```

2. Import the parser into your source code:

```python
from crispy.crispy import Crispy
```

3. Add your arguments:

```python
c = Crispy()
c.add_variable("name", str)
c.add_variable("age", int)
c.add_variable("salary", float)
```

4. Throw any user-inputted string or argument list at it!

```python
result = c.parse_string("--name John -a=21 --salary=30000.45")
print(result)
```

> {'name': 'John', 'age': 21, 'salary': 30000.45}

Or parse `sys.argv`:

```python
arguments = c.parse_arguments(sys.argv[1:])
print(arguments)
```

> {'message': 'message.txt', 'targets': 'targets.txt', 'url_format': 'api.txt'}
