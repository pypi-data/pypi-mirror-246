# Project Name: Clara-Term 🚀
An advanced terminal-based automation tool powered by AI – because who needs humans anymore? 🤖

## Description
Ever wished your computer could just 'get' you? Well, Clara-Term is basically a mind reader in the form of code. Powered by GPT-3.5 (with a VIP pass for GUVI-GPT and Llama2 coming soon), it's changing the game in script automation. Perfect for those who love Python 🐍 (and soon, Go and JavaScript aficionados). 

### Key Features
- **AI-Driven Script Wizardry:** Creates scripts so you don't have to. It's like magic, but real. ✨
- **Language Party:** Starts with Python, but Go and JavaScript are on the invite list. 🎉
- **Self-Healing Wizard:** It fixes its own boo-boos in scripts. Self-care at its finest. 🩹
- **Dependency Juggler:** Manages dependencies like a circus pro. 🎪
- **The Future is Bright:** Brace yourselves, GUVI-GPT and Llama2 are coming. 🌟

## Installation
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --editable .

Because who has time for complicated installations?
