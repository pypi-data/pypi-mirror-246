Server is located on the cloud and it is manteined by Next Industries s.r.l.
Server has a web interface where you can handle your profile and your data (models and gestures)

Provided Tactigon Gear SDK is the implementation of Tactigon Gear environment client side

Tactigon Gear SDK is used for collecting new raw data, send the data to server,
ask server to train a model using the raw data, and download the model from server. 
Finally use the model for testing real-time gesture recognition.
