These are a collection of blocks for the [PyMdown Extensions](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions) that I find useful.

This project is not affiliated with the PyMdown Extensions project and is currently in a very early stage. Currently, there is only one block: `DirTree`.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pymdownx-blocks
```

## Usage
This can be used in MkDocs or by itself. To use in a Python file, we use the following:

```python
import markdown

yaml_str=...
md=markdown.Markdown(extensions=['pymdownx_blocks.dirtree'])
```

To use in MkDocs, register the extension.

```yaml
...
markdown_extensions:
...
- pymdownx_blocks.dirtree
...
```

In a markdown file, 
```
///dirtree

root:
- subdir:
  - File
- another subdir:
  - anotherfile.txt
  - file.csv
///
```


When rendered, this will produce the following tree

<div>
<pre class="admonition note"><p class="admonition-title">Directory Structure</p>
<p> 
root
├── subdir 
│   └── File
└── another subdir
    ├── anotherfile.txt 
    └── file.csv
</p></pre>
</div>
