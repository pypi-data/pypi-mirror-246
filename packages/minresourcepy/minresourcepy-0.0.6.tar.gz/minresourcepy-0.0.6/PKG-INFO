# MinResourcepy
 Tools for Resource Geologists

 Hi there,

 This Python library is a continual work in progress, aimed at expanding with tools to assist and validate block models, along with tackling complex operations. It serves as a compilation and standardization of scripts developed (with the assistance of my colleagues) during my journey as a Resource Geo on Earth Planet!
 This Python library is a continual work in progress, and the goal is to keep building it, with tools that are useful for you to enhance and validate your block models, and make some complex operations also. It was created to organize and standardize the scripts that I (with the assistance of my colleagues) developed during my journey as a Resource Geo on Earth Planet! 
 It's open and collaborative, so your contributions to the code are more than welcome.

 ## Package Inventory
 1) **tongrade** - Generates values for a TonXGrade chart (both X and Y axis) with the option to choose proportion over tonnage as the output.
 2) **xyzrotate** - Allows rotation and unrotation of block models or points, akin to the CDTRAN function in Datamine.
 3) **pplot** -  Generates dynamic probability plots to aid in outlier definition.
 4) **describew** - Yields output similar to .describe(), considering a weight variable.
 5) **dist_reschart** - Generates a distance histogram for Mineral Resource classification, color-coding bars by category (measured, indicated, inferred). The X-axis denotes the sample distance to blocks (minimum or average depending on your objective).

## Next Updates
Future plans include creating package examples as a user guide and continually adding new tools.
