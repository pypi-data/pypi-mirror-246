## Getting Started 🏁

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some parts of the code are still in development and do not work!

All instalation instructons and documentation can be found [here](https://lodestone-documentation.vercel.app/ "docs") but here is the general idea.

Install
To start building a Lodestone based bot, you first have to install the lodestone, package. run the following command to install the package:
'''pip install lodestone'''

💡
If you already have the lodestone package installed you can skip this step, you only need to install lodestone for the bot to work.
Create a bot.py
Create the following bot.py file in your project’s root directory:
'''import lodestone
 
bot = lodestone.createBot(
  host='localhost',
  username='Bot',
)'''

With the above configuration, Lodestone will create a bot with the name bot that joins the java server localhost (localy run server). Other Lodestone bot creation configurations can be found Here.
Run your bot
After coding your very own Minecraft bot you can simply run the following command to start the bot!:
Terminal
# can be python3 on some systems
python bot.py

And run the next or next dev command specified in package.jsonto start developing the project! 🎉
Sign in
Lastly, if your not already signed in bot will ask you to sign in using Microsoft by default. The message will look something like this:
'''It seems you are not logged in, please go to https://microsoft.com/link and enter the following code: ********'''

after you sucsessfully sign in in to your account account the bot will be created.
Full auth configurations can be found here.
