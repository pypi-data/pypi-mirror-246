Lodestone is an incredibly powerful and flexible framework for building Minecraft bots of all kinds.
Whether you‚Äôre new to Minecraft bot development or a seasoned pro, Lodestone provides all the tools you need to bring your bot ideas to life.
Let‚Äôs dive into how to get up and running with Lodestone.

## Features

* Supports Minecraft 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20.1.

* Miscellaneous stuff such as knowing your health and whether it is raining.
* Activating blocks and using items.
* Chat.
* Plugins for many servers.

## Getting Started üèÅ

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some parts of the code are still in development and do not work!

All instalation instructons and documentation can be found [here](https://lodestone-documentation.vercel.app/ "docs") but here is the general idea.

#### Installation and Setup
The first step is to install the Lodestone package using pip. It‚Äôs recommended to create a virtual environment first before installing:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install lodestone
```
With Lodestone installed, create a bot.py file to initialize your bot. This is where you‚Äôll configure your bot‚Äôs username, authentication method, and other options:
```python
import lodestone
bot = lodestone.createBot(
  host='localhost',
  port=25565,  # set this to your own LAN port
  username='MyAwesomeBot',
  auth='microsoft' 
)
```
In this example, we‚Äôre connecting to a local Minecraft server on localhost and using Microsoft authentication.

##### Running and Logging In
With your bot created, run it using:
```bash
python bot.py
```
The first time you run your bot, Lodestone will prompt you to log in using the authentication method you configured. Follow the login prompts to authenticate your bot and connect it to the Minecraft server.
Lodestone provides multiple authentication options including Microsoft and Offline modes. See the docs for details.



### Uisng the Lodestone CLI

Lodestone also offers an easy to use command line intercace (CLI). This allows you to use the basic functions of lodestone.
the CLI offers auto tab complete and has real time chat logs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `username` and `host` are requierd options. üõë

> [!WARNING]
> Do not share your Minecraft info to anyone. üîí
