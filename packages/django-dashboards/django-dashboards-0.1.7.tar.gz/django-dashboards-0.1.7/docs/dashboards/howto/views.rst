===============
Views & Routing
===============

By default any ``Dashboard`` registered will have a generic view and url routing created for it as
long as you have included ``include('dashboards.urls')`` in your ``urls.py``
and ``DJANGO_DASHBOARDS_DASHBOARD_VIEWS = True`` (defualt) in your ``settings.py``

For example if you added the following dashboard to the app ``test``:

::

    class DemoDashboard(Dashboard):
        example = Text(value="Rendered on load")

        class Meta:
            name = "Demo"


and included in your route urls:

::

    # urls.py

    path('dashboards/', include('dashboards.urls')),


The dashboard will then be available at ``/dashboard/test/demodashboard/``, or using ``reverse``:

::

    # view.py

    reverse("dashboards:test_demodashboard")
    # reverse("<namespace>:<app_label>_<slug_dashboard_class_name>")

You can also provide a namespace as per Django's urls:

::

    # urls.py

    path("dashboards/", include("dashboards.urls", "customnamespace"))

    # view.py

    reverse("customnamespace:test_demodashboard")


Adding your own routes
----------------------

If you decide not to use the dynamic Dashboard routing & views, you can add your own.
Either by creating a route to the built in `DashboardView`:

::

    # urls.py

    path(
        "",
        DashboardView.as_view(dashboard_class=dashboards.DemoDashboard),
        name="demo-dashboard",
    ),

or including your Dashboard in a normal view:

::

    # urls.py
    from django.urls import path

    from .views import (
        StandardView,
    )

    path(
        "normal/",
        StandardView.as_view(),
        name="normal",
    ),

    # views.py

    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    from . import DemoDashboard

    class StandardView(TemplateView):
        template_name = "..."

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
            context["dashboard"] = DemoDashboard()
            return context

This can be taken further to allow for for multiple dashboards to be displayed in the same view, for example here
is how you'd make tabbed dashboards, which leverage HTMXs lazy loading and partial dashboards.


::

    # urls.py - as per above
    # views.py

    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    from . import DemoDashboard

    class TabbedView(TemplateView):
        template_name = "tabbed.html"

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
            tabs = [DemoDashboard(), DynamicDashboard(request=self.request)]
            context["tabs"] = tabs
            context["initial_tab"] = tabs[0]
            # you'd need to combine the media for each tab, for ease just use the first dashboards media here
            context["dashboard"] = tabs[0]
            return context

    # templates/tabbed.html

    {% extends "dashboards/dashboard.html" %}

    {% comment %}
        Note this example uses Alpine.js to control the tabs, it's an excellent library to use
        alongside HTMX and is incuded in dashboards example js.
    {% endcomment %}

    {% block content %}
        <div class="tabs" hx-target="#partial-dashboard" x-data="{ tab: '{{ selected_url }}'">
            {% for dashboard in tabs %}
                <div class="tab">
                    <a hx-get="{{ dashboard.get_absolute_url }}" :class="tab == '{{ dashboard.get_absolute_url }}' && 'active'" x-on:click="tab = '{{ dashboard.get_absolute_url }}';">{{ dashboard.Meta.name }}</a>
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
        <div id="partial-dashboard" hx-get="{{ initial_tab.get_absolute_url }}" hx-trigger="load" class="dashboard-container"></div>
    {% endblock %}


Please note there are caveats to adding your own routes:

* If you only want your own views you can disable ``DJANGO_DASHBOARDS_DASHBOARD_VIEWS``. Noting that you will still be leveraging the component and form fetch views included in the package.
* If you decide not to use ``DashboardView`` any permissions_classes will not be applied.


Custom component views
----------------------

django-dashboards comes bundled with URLs to handle deferred components, however, if need arises you can also add your own. For example:


::

    # urls.py
    from django.urls import path

    from .views import (
        NoTemplateComponentDeferView,
        CustomComponentView,
    )

    from dashboards.urls import COMPONENT_PATTERN
    from dashboards.views import DashboardView

    path(
        "customcomponent/" + COMPONENT_PATTERN,
        CustomComponentView.as_view(),
        name="custom-component",
    ),
    path(
        "notemplatecomponentdefer/" + COMPONENT_PATTERN,
        NoTemplateComponentDeferView.as_view(),
        name="custom-component-defer",
    ),


    # views.py

    from django.http import HttpRequest, HttpResponse

    from dashboards.views import ComponentView


    class CustomComponentView(ComponentView):
        def get(self, request: HttpRequest, *args, **kwargs):
            return HttpResponse("Simple response")


    class NoTemplateComponentDeferView(ComponentView):
        def get(self, request: HttpRequest, *args, **kwargs):
            dashboard = self.get_dashboard(request=request)
            component = self.get_partial_component(dashboard=dashboard)

            # Call the value direct to response, which is essentially what
            # ComponentView does minus applying the template.
            return HttpResponse(component.get_value(request=request, call_deferred=True))


    # dashboards.py

    class CustomComponentDashboard(Dashboard):
        custom_response = Text(
            defer_url=lambda reverse_args: reverse(
                "custom-component", args=reverse_args
            ),
        )

        no_template_response_defer = Text(
            defer=lambda **kwargs: "Simple Response Via Defer",
            defer_url=lambda reverse_args: reverse(
                "custom-component-defer", args=reverse_args
            ),
        )

A use case for this is :doc:`Async components <async>` .
