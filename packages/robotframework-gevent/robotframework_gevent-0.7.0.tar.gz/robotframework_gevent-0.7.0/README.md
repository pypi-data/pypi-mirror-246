## installation:
```bash
pip install robotframework-gevent
```

## Usage:

```robotframework
# simple-test.robot
*** Settings ***

Library             Collections
Library             String
Library             GeventLibrary
Library             RequestsLibrary


*** Test Cases ***
Test1
    [Documentation]    Simple test flow with gevent greenlets
    Log    Hello World
    Create Gevent Bundle    alias=alias1  # Create a bundle of coroutines
    Sleep    10s    alias=alias1    # run your synchronous keyword
    # register all your keywords as coroutines to the gevent bundle
    Add Coroutine    Sleep Wrapper    alias=alias1
    Add Coroutine    Sleep    20s    alias=alias1
    Add Coroutine    Sleep    10s    alias=alias1
    Add Coroutine    GET    https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1    alias=alias1
    Add Coroutine    Convert To Lower Case    UPPER

    # Run your coroutines and get the values by order
    ${values}    Run Coroutines    alias=alias1
    Log Many    @{values}

    # The 3rd coroutine was a request, take it's value
    ${jsonplaceholder_resp}    Get From List    ${values}    3

    # assert the returned response code to be 200
    Status Should Be    200    ${jsonplaceholder_resp}
    # assert that the returned `userId` field equals to 1
    Should Be Equal As Strings    1    ${jsonplaceholder_resp.json()['userId']}


*** Keywords ***
Sleep Wrapper
    Sleep    1s

```


See -  [Keyword Documentation](https://eldaduzman.github.io/robotframework-gevent/GeventLibrary.html)
### run test:
```
>>> robot simple-test.robot
```
### Possible result

After test is completed go to `log.html`:

Owing to the fact that keywords are executed asynchronously, we cannot know the order of keyword execution, so instead they are printed in a table format

## Motivation

Modern software architecture is `event driven`, with many background process.
Servers are being more pro-active instead of re-active as we see in a `client server` architecture.

In order to test such systems, we need the ability to run coroutines in our test scripts.

With the power of [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/), we can run several coroutines in greenlets, so integrating them into our robotframework test script will provide super powers to our testing efforts!

## Why gevent?

Concurrency can be achieved in 3 different ways:

1.  Multiprocessing - running each task in it's own `process`.
    The cons of such an approach would be massive consumption of resources, namely CPU and memory, as this means to allocate an entire `memory heap` to each task.
    Another problem is a possible need for `Inter-Process Communication (IPC)` that might be costly.

2.  Multithreading - running each task in a `thread`.
    Unlike multiprocessing, now all tasks run on the same memory heap and separated by threads, which the CPU coordinates using `round-robin`.
    However, python's  `Global Interpreter Lock` (GIL) prevents these threads from acting concurrently, it might perform context switching when IO operation occurs but there's no control for that.


3.  Asynchronous IO - running all tasks on a single thread, while IO operations won't block the progress of the program, while code execution is committed by an   `event loop` that `selects` between attached `coroutines`.
    This is highly efficient in resources consumption when compared to multithreading and multiprocessing, but it requires some modifications to the original code.
    `Blocking` IO statements can hog the event loop and the code will not be concurrent.
    `gevent` allows programmers to write seemingly regular "blocking" python code, but it will enforce asynchronous IO compliance by `monkey patching`
