homeostasis

	priorities:
		health scan and health advancents, 
		checked with "body_scan" and modules that use "body_scan"
		
		
	limitations (the structure):
	
		The idea is that building codependecies (or cyclic depedencies)
		into the status assertation framework is a recipe for confusion.
	
		As in, homeostasis perhaps shouldn't include a module that
		requires homeostasis for status assertation.
	
		Therefore the directed acyclic chart of status check frameworks is:
			
			[ unit test, pytest ] -> "body_scan" -> homeostasis
	
		details:
			story 3:
				homeostasis:
					status requires: 
						body_scan
					
					requires: 
						botanical:
							status: body_scan
		
			story 2:
				body_scan:
					status requires: 
						unit test
					
					requires: 
						botanist:
							status: pytest

			story 1:
				unit test:
				
	journal:
		1:
			This is module started as a replica of "body_scan",
			where it uses "body_scan" as the status monitor.
			
			In contrast, "body_scan" uses unittest as the status
			monitor.
