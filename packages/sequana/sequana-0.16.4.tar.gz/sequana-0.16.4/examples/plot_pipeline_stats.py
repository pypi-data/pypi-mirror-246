# Proportions of rules re-used

# Amongst the rules, about a third of the rules are not used at all in the pipelines.
# There are two reasons: either they were part of previous pipeline versions and
# were discarded in favour of new tools, or there were used for testing and kept
# in case of.

# Then, we can see that a third of the rules are used only once. And finally, about
# a third used more than once.
