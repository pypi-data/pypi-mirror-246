        Calculates the distribution of grades for an exam based on predefined thresholds.

        This method computes grades for an exam by first determining the maximum possible score for the exam.

        Based on predefined grade thresholds (A, B, C, D, E, F), each candidate's score is classified into a grade category.

        exam (ExamType): An instance of an Exam class. 

        Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with keys as grade categories ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F') and values as the count of candidates in each category.
