        Extracts and converts question-related data from an exam object into a list of Box objects.

        This method iterates through each question in the provided exam object. 
        For each question, it retrieves the question number and the correct portion of answers. 
        The correct portion is then converted into a percentage. 
        Each of these elements is used to create a Box object, which is appended to a list. 
        The list of Box objects is then returned in reverse order.

        Parameters:
        exam (ExamType): An instance of an Exam class. 
        This object should have methods getQuestionIds, getQuestionNr, and getCorrectPortion for accessing exam data.

        Returns:
        list[Box]: A list of Box objects, each representing a question's number and the percentage of correct answers. 
        The list is returned in reverse order of the questions in the exam.

        Raises:
        TypeError: If the types of the returned values from exam methods are not as expected.
        ZeroDivisionError: If there is a division by zero when calculating the correct percentage.

        exam (ExamType): An instance of an Exam class from which data is extracted. 
            The class should be compatible with Box.extractFromExam method.
