## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository is actively maintained by [Aflorithmic Labs](https://www.aflorithmic.ai/). For examples, recipes and api reference see the [api.audio docs](https://docs.api.audio/reference). Feel free to get in touch with any questions or feedback!

## :book:  Changelog

You can view [here](CHANGELOG.md) our updated Changelog.

## :speedboat:  Quickstarts <a name = "quickstarts"></a>

Get started with our [quickstart recipes](https://github.com/aflorithmic/examples).

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Installation

You don't need this source code unless you want to modify it. If you want to use the package, just run:

```sh
pip install audiostack -U
#or
pip3 install audiostack -U
```


### Prerequisites <a name = "requirements"></a>

Python 3.6+

## üöÄ Hello World <a name = "hello_world"></a>

Create a file `hello.py`

```python
touch hello.py
```

### Authentication

This library needs to be configured with your account's api-key which is available in your [api.audio Console](https://console.api.audio). Import the apiaudio package and set `apiaudio.api_key` with the api-key you got from the console:

```python
import audiostack
audiostack.api_key = "your-key"
```


### Create Text to audio in 4 steps

Let's create our first audio asset.

‚úçÔ∏è Create a new script, our `scriptText` will be the text that is later synthesized.

```python
script = audiostack.Content.Script.create(scriptText="hello world")
print(script.message, script.scriptId)
```

üé§ Render the scriptText that was created in the previous step. Lets use voice Aria. Lets download our tts file also.

```python
tts = audiostack.Speech.TTS.create(scriptItem=script, voice="Aria")
print(tts)
tts.download(autoName=True)
```

üéß Now let's mix the speech we just created with a sound template.

```python
mix = audiostack.Production.Mix.create(speechItem=tts, soundTemplate="jakarta")
print(mix)
```

Lets convert out produced mix into a mp3 and download it.

```python
enc = audiostack.Delivery.Encoder.encode_mix(productionItem=mix, preset="mp3_low")
enc.download()
```

Easy right? üîÆ This is the final `hello.py` file.

```python
import audiostack
audiostack.api_key = "your-key"

script = audiostack.Content.Script.create(scriptText="hello world")
print(script.message, script.scriptId)

tts = audiostack.Speech.TTS.create(scriptItem=script, voice="Aria")
print(tts)
tts.download(autoName=True)

mix = audiostack.Production.Mix.create(speechItem=tts, soundTemplate="jakarta")
print(mix)

enc = audiostack.Delivery.Encoder.encode_mix(productionItem=mix, preset="mp3_low")
enc.download()
```

Now let's run the code:

```sh
python hello.py
#or
python3 hello.py
```

Once this has completed, find the downloaded audio asset and play it! :sound: :sound: :sound: 


### Import <a name = "import"></a>

```python
import audiostack
```

### Authentication <a name = "authentication"></a>

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key which is available in your [Aflorithmic Dashboard](https://console.api.audio). Set `audiostack.api_key` with the api-key you got from the dashboard:

```python
audiostack.api_key = "your-key"
```

### Authentication with environment variable (recommended) <a name = "authentication_env"></a>

You can also authenticate using `audiostack_key` environment variable and the apiaudio SDK will automatically use it. To setup, open the terminal and type:

```sh
export audiostack_key=<your-key>
```

If you provide both an environment variable and `audiostack.api_key` authentication value, the `audiostack.api_key` value will be used instead.

### Logging <a name = "logging"></a>

By default, warnings issued by the API are logged in the console output. Additionally, some behaviors are logged on the informational level (e.g. "In progress..." indicators during longer processing times).
The level of logging can be controlled by choosing from the standard levels in Python's `logging` library.

- Decreasing logging level for more detailed logs:
  ```python
  audiostack.set_logger_level("INFO")
  # audiostack.set_logger_level("CRITICAL") - set the highest level to disable logs
  ```

<!-- ### Super Organizations

In order to control a child organization of yours, please use the following method to *assume* that organization id.

Set your child organization id to `None` to stop assuming an organization. Subsequent calls to the api will use your own organization id.

```python
import apiaudio

apiaudio.set_assume_org_id('child_org_id')

# Stop using
apiaudio.set_assume_org_id(None)
```

See [organization](#organization) resource for more operations you can perform about your organization. -->

### `Diction` resource <a name = "diction"> </a>
#### Product Description
Our dictionary service is...


---
- `create()` Add word to a custom dictionary


	``` audiostack.Speech.Diction.create(<args>)```


	For each language, only a single word entry is permitted. However, each word can have multiple specializations. When a word is first registered a default specialization is always created, which will match what is passed in. Subsequent calls with different specializations will only update the given specialization. The exact repacement that will be used is determined by the following order of preference:voice name > language dialect > provider name > defaultFor example, a replacement specified for voice name sara will be picked over a replacement specified for provider azure.
	- Parameters:
		 - `lang` (string) - Language family, e.g. en or es.dictionary - use global to register a word globally (default).
		 - `word` *[required] (string) - Word to be replaced.
		 - `replacement` *[required] (string) - The replacement token. Can be either a plain string or a IPA token.
		 - `contentType` (string) - The content type of the supplied replacement, can be either basic (default) or ipa for phonetic replacements.

### `Script` resource <a name = "script"> </a>
#### Product Description

Simply put, a script is the format that makes creating and audio with audiostacks, accessible, scalable and awesome. In summary a script contains a series of commands for producing beautifully rendered text-to-speech, that can later be mixed with custom media files and dynamically adjustable sound templates. In the most basic example, a script with the text ``hello world`` will permit our speech services #here to render a syntehtic rendition of the words ``hello world``.

To annotate a script we have a collection of *markup* syntax used to signify sections, sound effects, dictionary flags and more.

These can be grouped as:

### Section Tag:
The sytax for this uses ``<< tagName :: identifier >>``, for example ``<<sectionName::into>>`` to signify the following script text belongs to the intro section. Valid tag names are `sectionName`, `soundSegment`, `soundEffect`, ,`media`.

### Dictionary flag:
The syntax for a dictionary flag uses either `<!word>` or ``<` word or sentence>``. The first is used when a word can have multiple pronunciations, for example, the french city *"Nice"*, ordinarily it would be pronounced as nice (as in what a nice place to eat), to force the alterative pronunciation, words should be marked with the `<!nice>` syntax. The ``<`>`` syntax is used to force the text between the start ``<` `` and end `>` flags to be preserved as is, i.e. no text correction services are applied. See this link for more documentation on this.

### Audience parameters
Audience parameter syntax can be used to customise or 'fill in' variable words/text during the TTS creation stage. The syntax for this is ``{{name|default text}}``, for example you might have the the scriptText ``"hello {{name|new user}} and welcome to audio stack"``. This permits a single script to be created, and have unlimited variants of this synthesised with our speech creation services. See here for a comprehensive guide to audience parameters.

### SSML
SSML stands for Speech Synthesis Markup Language, and many TTS providors supply a collection of these tags for customising the sonice rendering of TTS voices, for example, changing prosidy, speaking speed, or inserting pauses between words. The syntax is ``<SSMLTagName parameters> ``, for a comprehensive list of SSML tags see this helpful guide.


---
- `create()` Create a Script resource.


	``` audiostack.Content.Script.create(<args>)```


	Creates a new script resource. Scripts are organised by directories, of which there are 3, projectName, moduleName, scriptName. Within this structure an indivdual script has a scriptId that is unique. It is possible to have multiple scripts under a given ``projectName/moduleName/scriptName`` structure. Therefore repeated calls to this endpoint will create multiple scripts. Use script update (PUT) to update an existing script (with its unique scriptId)A script's default version is v0. You can create multiple versions of one scriptId, which is handy in cases of multilingual coverage, targeted content etc. To create another version of a script use the PUT method.
	- Parameters:
		 - `projectName` (string) - 
		 - `moduleName` (string) - 
		 - `scriptName` (string) - 
		 - `scriptText` *[required] (string) - 

---
- `update()` Updates a Script resource.


	``` audiostack.Content.Script.update(<args>)```


	Updates an existing script resource. Additional versions can be appended to a given scriptId. To do this supply the version field with a named version. For example, `en` or `es`. By default `v0` is reserved and represents the fist version created when the original script was created with a (POST) request.
	- Parameters:
		 - `scriptId` *[required] (string) - The scriptId of the resource to be updated.
		 - `scriptText` *[required] (string) - Script text to replace, or add to new version
		 - `version` (string) - By default this will update v0, however you can set this field to update/create an additional version of this scriptId
