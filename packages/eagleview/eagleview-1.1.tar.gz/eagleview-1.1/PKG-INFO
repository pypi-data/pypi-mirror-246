A package for greatly increasing the visualisation of datasets, in minimal lines of code.

```
### Method 1
1. Clone the repository:

```bash

```bash
!pip install eagleview
```
```python
import eagleview
```

<hr>


### Input:

```python
#v0.x
from eagleview.figshow import ImageMatrix

image_display = ImageMatrix('/content/path_to_folder_containing_images')
```


```python
#v1.x
from eagleview.figshow import ImageMatrix

im = ImageMatrix('/content/path_to_folder_containing_images', '/content/path_to_file_containing_label.csv')
#only .csv extension
```

### Output:
```python
#v1.0
im.rand((a, b)).display_image( # a,b is the size of matrix
    check_col='col_name', # replace 'col_name' with the name of column, which has image name
    display_label=True,  # by default this is False
    display_cols=['col1', 'col2'], # replace '', to the column name which you want to print as label
    display_name=True, # by default this is False
    print_all=False, # by default this is True
    x= , # X-coordinate of label
    y= , # Y-coordinate of label
    fig_size=(m, n) # by default this is set to max(image_size), maximum size of all the images which will be displayed
)

```
```python
#v0.2
(ImageMatrix('/content/path_to_folder_containing_images').rand()).display_image((2,2), print_all=False, display_name=True)
```
```python
# v0.1
(ImageMatrix('/content/path_to_folder_containing_images')).display_image((2,2), print_all=False)
```

## Releases: 
- `v0.1`
