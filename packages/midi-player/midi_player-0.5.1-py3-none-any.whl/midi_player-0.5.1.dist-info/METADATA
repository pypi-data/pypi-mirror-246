# midi-player
Python launcher of the [`html-midi-player`](https://github.com/cifkao/html-midi-player) by [@cifkao](https://github.com/cifkao) &amp; [@magenta](https://github.com/magenta)

Works with local and web-hosted MIDI files in Jupyter, Colab, WandB,...probably other contexts. 

# Installation

```
pip install midi-player
```

# Usage

Only tested with Jupyter Notebooks & Colab, but uses no IPython dependencies so it *should* work in other contexts.
```python

from midi_player import MIDIPlayer
from midi_player.stylers import basic, cifka_advanced

midi_file_url = "https://magenta.github.io/magenta-js/music/demos/melody.mid"
midi_file = "data/test_midi.mid"

MIDIPlayer(midi_file_url, 400)  
MIDIPlayer(midi_file, 160, styler=cifka_advanced, title='My Player')
```

With `wandb`:
```python
import wandb

wandb.login()
wandb.init(project="midi-player")
mp = MIDIPlayer(midi_file, 300, viz_type="waterfall")
wandb.log({'player':wandb.Html(mp.html)})
wandb.finish()

```

See `examples/` for more.

# Documentation

TO-DO. Particularly, people will want to know how to add/customize their own "stylers". 
See `midi_player/*.py` for now ;-).

# Known Issues / Release Notes
* Not sure why the staff view is putting out 32nd notes / how to tell it to do 8th notes instead.
* v0.5.1: Lightened title text color in Dark Mode for better visibility on dark backgrounds
* v0.5: Added `title=` kwarg, as workaround b/c Quarto mixes up ordering of `print` and IFrame elements
* v0.4: Refactored `stylers.py`. Added a `dark` mode styler. 
* v0.3: Added an optional Download link! (Maybe you'll think it's ugly but it works.) Note: WandB disables usual opening-in-new tab browser behavior, so on WandB you'll need to Right-Click the download link and choose "Open in New Tab" to get the file.
