DataTrails Scitt Receipt Verification in python
===============================================

Python support for the offline verification of scitt receipts for DataTrails events.


**Notice**: This work is based on the *draft* standard draft-birkholz-scitt-receipts-02_ . This work and the upstream standard will evolve. We make no current promise of api stability

Python Support
==============

This package currently is tested against Python versions 3.8,3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.

The current default version is 3.8 - this means that this package will not
use any features specific to versions 3.9 and later.

After End of Life of a particular Python version, support is offered on a best effort
basis. We may ask you to update your Python version to help solve the problem,
if it cannot be reasonably resolved in your current version.
