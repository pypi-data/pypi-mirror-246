# Keying for the object store

DataSource - can be a particular site/instrument/height

These can then be identified by Site, instrument etc

/data/uid/{datasource_uid}

Can then key the data 

/data/uid/{datasource_uid}/{datestart_dateend}


/datasource/uid/{uid}

This returns information regarding that datasource


Then for instruments

/instruments/uid/{instrument_uid}

This returns a JSON containing the UIDs of all the DataSources provided by the instrument

Then for sites

/site/uid/{site_uid}


This returns a JSON of all the UIDs of the instruments provided by the instrument


Then for networks

/networks/uid/{network_uid}

This gives the JSOON that describes the network, including all the Instruments for that network


We should also be able to lookup the networks and instruments by name

/instruments/name/{encdoded_name}

This would then return a JSON containing information regarding that instrument including its UID, full name, location, network etc
