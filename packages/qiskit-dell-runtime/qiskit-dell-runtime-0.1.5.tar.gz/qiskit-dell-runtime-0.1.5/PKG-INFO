                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Qiskit Dell Runtime
Qiskit Dell Runtime is a [Qiskit Runtime](https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-runtime) platform that can execute classical-quantum code on both local and on-premise environments. With this platform, hybrid classical-quantum code bundle can be developed and executed. Powered by Qiskit Runtime API, this execution model provides close-integration of classical and quantum execution. 

Various simulation, emulation and quantum hardware can be integrated with this platform. Developers can abstract their source code with Qiskit, so that execution can be ported across execution environments with minimum effort. 

At this time the Qiskit-Dell-Runtime has been tested on Linux and Windows.

## Getting Started with Qiskit
The Qiskit Dell Runtime is an platform for running hybrid classical-quantum algorithms in local and remote execution environments. To get started using the platform, it is recommended that you have some experience with Qiskit first.

You can find plenty of tutorials and introductory materials provided by Qiskit [here](https://qiskit.org/learn/).

## Architecture
This platform provides both client-side provider and server-side components. 

![Qiskit Runtime Architecture](images/arch.png)
### Client-side Provider
Users would need to install the `DellRuntimeProvider` on client devices. The provider is defaulted to local execution and can be used out of the box. This provider can also be used to connect with platform running on a server-side, so that users can control server and execute jobs by using the same API. 

### Server-side Components
This platform has a minimalist design to create a light-weighted execution environment for server-side components. It contains an `orchestrator` long-running microservice that listens to requests from `DellRuntimeProvider`. 

At runtime, when a job is started by user, a new pod will be created to execute both classical and vQPU workload. 

For deployment installation, please visit this [link](doc/install.md). 

### Database Configuration
All user-uploaded code and execution parameters will be stored in a database. By default, this platform comes with a [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) deployment. If users would like to customize database to another database service, please view these installations for database configuration. 

### SSO
SSO integration is off by default, so that users can easily set up a sandbox environment. There is existing integration hooks built into the platform for easy integration with various SSO systems. 

### Multi-Backend Support
By default, the quantum execution will be processed by [Qiskit Aer](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer) simulation engine. Users can modify the quantum backend by specifying `backend-name` in the job input parameter. Custom code adjustment can be made to support multiple [Qiskit backends](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.html), including other emulation, simulation and QPU backends. 

## Emulation vs Simulation
While simulation engines execute quantum circuits to measure probablistic outcome, emulation engines calculate outcome for algorithms with deterministic calculations. 

**The Hybrid Emulation Platform can support both simulation and emulation,** depending on the backend used. 

You can read about the VQE example provided in [our documentation](doc/examples.ipynb) or in a [Qiskit Tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/algorithms/04_vqe_advanced.html) if you want to learn more about when it may be beneficial to use either emulation or simulation over the other.

Emulations for different use cases are under-development, and we are looking for feedback to better prioritize on use cases. If you have a use-case in mind, please contact us at [v.fong@dell.com](mailto:v.fong@dell.com).
