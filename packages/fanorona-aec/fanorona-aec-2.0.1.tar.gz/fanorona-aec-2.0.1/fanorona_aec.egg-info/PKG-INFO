This is an implementation of the Fanorona board game as a [PettingZoo](https://github.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo) [AEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13051) game.
The rules have been sourced from [here](https://www.mindsports.nl/index.php/the-pit/528-fanorona).
An additional rule where games exceeding $44$ moves end in a draw has been implemented, since the
original rules do not have explicit draw conditions.

## Installation

### Using pip (recommended)

```bash
python -m pip install fanorona-aec
```

### Local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/fanorona-aec.git
cd fanorona-aec
python -m pip install .
```

## Usage

### Setting up a basic environment

In a Python shell, run the following:

```python
import fanorona_aec
env = fanorona_v2.env()
```

See [`demo.py`](./demo.py) for a script that implements a simple random policy to interact with the environment.

## Testing

We use [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/) for tests. You can run them via:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhijeetKrishnan/fanorona-aec.git
cd fanorona-aec
python -m pip install .[dev]
pytest
```
