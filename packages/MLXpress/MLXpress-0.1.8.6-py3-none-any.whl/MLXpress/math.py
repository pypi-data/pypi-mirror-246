    Notes:
    The cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors
    of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them.
    It is often used as a similarity metric for documents or vectors in N-dimensional space.

    The formula for cosine similarity between two vectors v1 and v2 is given by:
    cosine_sim(v1, v2) = dot_product(v1, v2) / (magnitude(v1) * magnitude(v2))

    where dot_product is the dot product of v1 and v2, and magnitude is the magnitude of a vector.
