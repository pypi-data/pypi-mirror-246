Import Python modules straight from the cloud (e.g. GitHub) at runtime!

## Installation
* pip: `pip install cloud_import`
* no pip: copy [cloud_import.py](cloud_import/could_import.py) into your project

## Usage
See [examples/example1.py](examples/example1.py)

## Why?
This can be used to entirely skip the 'deployment' step for internal tooling, not meant for distribution or public usage. 

## Limitations
* No dependency handling
* Fixed URL structure: the source code for module `foo.bar` must be accessible at `<url>/foo/bar/*.py`
* Bad things will happen if the cloud source code changes while a package (with multiple modules) is being imported
