# KnoxTokenLibary-Python ('pyktl')

**This is not an offical Samsung library or repository**

pyktl is a python rewrite of the knox-token-library-js library written by Samsung.  The following code was used to build this project. https://www.npmjs.com/package/knox-token-library-js?activeTab=readme

The prerequesits for this library are: 
```
pip install pycryptodome "pyjwt[crypto]"
```

## Usage

Install using: 
```
pip install pyktl
```

### Assumptions 
 - You have downloaded the Knox Certificate file (certificate.json)
 - You have generated a Client Identifier (api-key) for accessing apis of Knox Cloud Services.

### Intended Use
The workflow for making api calls to Knox Cloud Services is divided into a portal workflow, and a programmatic workflow.
Portal flow

 - Download Certificate from Knox Api Portal
 - Generate and Download ClientIdentifier (api-key) for a specific Knox Solution

### Programmatic flow

 - Call Knox api to generate an Api Access Token. This api call requires a signed ClientIdentifier, and specific contents of your Certificate (Public Key).
 - Call Knox api for your intended workflow (eg: upload device, configure device etc). This api call requires your signed Api Access Token, and specific contents of your Certificate (Public Key).

 - This utility py library helps generate signed clientIdentifiers, and signed accessTokens.

## Included Examples
Leverage the KnoxAccessToken.py & test_KmeApi.py examples that show successful authetnication to the Knox Mobile Enrollment ('KME') api.

The example leverages a keys.json which is obtained using the SamsungKnox.com portal - view the Samsung tutorial for more details. 
The example also leverages clientId.json which includes the clientIds 

```
{
    "kme": "",
    "kc": "",
    "ke1": "",
    "kai": ""
}
```
You can also reference Samsung's authentication tutorail found here: https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-cloud-authentication/tutorial/tutorial-for-customers-generate-access-token/. 
I did attempt to keep only required method names, so not all methods in the docs will be available in pyktl.


## Local Build & Install
In order to build and install pyktl locally you can run the following commands:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install .
```

Note - the above requires prerequesit wheel

```
pip install wheel
```
