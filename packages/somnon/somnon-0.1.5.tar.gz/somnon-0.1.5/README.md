Quick and dirty Rust like Option and Result implementation.

Influence from Rust std::option and std::result

This package implements many of the Rust Option and Result monad features. Some names have been altered slightly to prevent clashes with reserved keywords and clashes with builtins.

## Installation

pip install somnon
~~~

## Usage

Examples in progress. In the time being read through the above rust-docs, they mostly cover everything anyway.
