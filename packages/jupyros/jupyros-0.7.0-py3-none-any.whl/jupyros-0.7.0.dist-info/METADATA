# ROS Support for jupyter notebooks

While the Jupyter ecosystem has been widely adopted by
the Data Science and Machine Learning community, the
robotics community has not jumped on the band wagon yet!
Most tools around ROS, the Robot Operating System, are
built using Python and QT.

However, using QT separates the user away from the code.
We've built a set of ROS tools for jupyter
notebook, trying to promote a rich, interactive experience
for Robotics developers utilizing the power of the jupyter
notebook.

With jupyter-ros, it's possible to easily create widgets for
custom message types to send messages.

If you find this package useful, don't hesitate to
contribute!

## Installation and Dependencies

You need a ROS environment with rospy. We recommend using [Robostack](https://github.com/RoboStack/ros-noetic) (follow their installation instructions) which allows you to install ROS in a conda environment.
Also required are `numpy` and `bqplot` for the live-plotting, 
`ipywidgets` for the interactive widgets, and `ipycanvas` for the Turtlesim animations.

    conda install jupyter bqplot pyyaml ipywidgets ipycanvas

`pyyaml` is necessary for rospy.

To install use conda or mamba:

    conda install jupyter-ros -c robostack

##### Development installation
You can create a dev environment with:
```bash
conda create -n jupyros -c conda-forge python nodejs=14 jupyterlab=3 jupyter bqplot pyyaml ipywidgets ipycanvas
```

For a development installation (requires npm),

    git clone https://github.com/RoboStack/jupyter-ros.git
    cd jupyter-ros
    pip install -e .
    jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix jupyros
    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyros


To update the `defaults.js` javascript you need to run `python jupyros/ros3d.py`.


## Troubleshooting

You might see a warning like "The rospy package is not found in your $PYTHONPATH.
Subscribe and publish are not going to work. Do you need to activate your ROS environment?"

This is harmless during installation, but if you see this warning in a notebook, you should check that your ROS environment is activated. You can also set the path from inside the notebook using

```
import sys
sys.path.append('/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/')

# The next line should now work!
import jupyros
```

If you got the following error when you run a cell ```failed to display Jupyter Widget of type VBox```,
you can solve it by running the following command ```jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension```
