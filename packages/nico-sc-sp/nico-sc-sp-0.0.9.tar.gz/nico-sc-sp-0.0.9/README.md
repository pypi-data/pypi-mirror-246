# NiCo

Developed by Ankit Agrawal (c) Gr√ºn lab 2023

Find covariation patterns between interacting cell types from image-based single cell resolution spatial transcriptomics data.


A package that performs cell type annotations on spatial transcriptomics data, finds the niche interactions and covariation patterns between interacting cell types.

Ready for use! Tutorials and Documentation are available!
