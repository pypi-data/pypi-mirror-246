# NiCo

Developed by Ankit Agrawal (c) Gr√ºn lab 2023


Find covariation patterns between interacted cell types from image-based single cell resolution of spatial data.

A package that performs cell type annotations on spatial transcriptomics data, find the niche interactions and covariation patterns between interacted cell types.

Under construction! Ready for use! Currently experimenting and planning!


## Install the NiCo package using the conda environment.  

```shell
conda create -n nicoUser python=3.11
conda activate nicoUser
pip install nico-sc-sp
pip install jupyterlab
```

# Required packages built upon
By default, these packages should install automatically.
But if any version conflict exists, the user can install the specific version independently using pip command.

# Import the functions from the Python prompt in the following way.  

```python
from nico import Annotations as sann
from nico import Interactions as sint
from nico import Covariations as scov
```
