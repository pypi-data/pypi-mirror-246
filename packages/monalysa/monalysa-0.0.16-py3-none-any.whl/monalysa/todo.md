# Features
We want to implement support for measures for different areas of work in movement science. We will add more features if interst in the library grows in the community.
* Dynamic time warping
* Automatic data segmentation


# Implementation detials
* Get rid of the lfilter step in computing average use and intensity to avoid uncessary filtering of the entire time series.

# Tutorial
* Record data from an accelerometer from discrete reaching movements for smoothness tutorial with IMU
* Record ActiGraph data to demonstrate the ulfunc features of monalysa
* Record motion capture data for different types of movements to demonstrate: preprocessing, smoothness, etc.
