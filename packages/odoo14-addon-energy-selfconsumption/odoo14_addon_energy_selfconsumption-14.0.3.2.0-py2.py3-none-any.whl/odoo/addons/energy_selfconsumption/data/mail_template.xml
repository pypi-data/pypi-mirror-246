        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>
            Remember that the collective self-consumption project
            <b>${ object.name }</b>
            of the energy community
            <b>${ object.project_id.company_id.name }</b>
            must invoice on the day <b>${ ctx['next_invoicing'] }</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is necessary, therefore, that you enter into Odoo the energy generated in kWh during the period
            <b>${ ctx['first_date'] }</b>
            - <b>${ ctx['last_date'] }</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To do so, go to the project file, enter the contracts view, select the contracts that must be invoiced and
            press the Invoice button.</br>
