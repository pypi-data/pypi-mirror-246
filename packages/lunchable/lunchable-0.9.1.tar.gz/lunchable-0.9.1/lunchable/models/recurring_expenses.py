        Get Recurring Expenses

        Retrieve a list of recurring expenses to expect for a specified period.

        Every month, a different set of recurring expenses is expected. This is because recurring
        expenses can be once a year, twice a year, every 4 months, etc.

        If a recurring expense is listed as “twice a month”, then that recurring expense will be
        returned twice, each with a different billing date based on when the system believes that
        recurring expense transaction is to be expected. If the recurring expense is listed as
        “once a week”, then that recurring expense will be returned in this list as many times as
        there are weeks for the specified month.

        In the same vein, if a recurring expense that began last month is set to “Every 3
        months”, then that recurring expense will not show up in the results for this month.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start_date : Optional[datetime.date]
            Date to search. By default will return the first day of the current month
        debit_as_negative: bool
            Pass in true if you'd like expenses to be returned as negative amounts and credits as
            positive amounts.

        Returns
