# üì¶ TornAPIWrapper v1.0.0
A Python wrapper for the [Torn City API](https://www.torn.com/api.html), providing access to [Torn City](https://www.torn.com) data.

# üì† Instructions
1. Install the TornAPIWrapper package by typing `pip tornapiwrapper` in your CMD.
2. Check out [examples](Examples) and [documentations](#-documentations) to familiarize yourself with the API.
3. Create an [API key](https://www.torn.com/preferences.php#tab=api).
4. Start programming!

# üìë Documentations
There are two Torn City API documentations that I recommend reading to understand how the API works.

- **[Official Torn API Docs](https://www.torn.com/api.html):** This is the official Torn City API documentation, that is not properly documented. I only recommend this as it is official documentation.
<br><br>
- **[Unofficial Torn API Docs](https://tornapi.tornplayground.eu):** This is the unofficial Torn City API documentation, that is well documented and has an active and open-source [repository](https://github.com/Torn-Playground/tornapi-documentation).
