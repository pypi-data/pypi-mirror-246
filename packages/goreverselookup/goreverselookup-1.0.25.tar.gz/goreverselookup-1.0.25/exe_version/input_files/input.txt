# --- Input file for GO Reverse Lookup --- #
#
# The input file contains the following sections: 
#   - settings
#   - processes
#   - categories
#   - GO_terms
# Each section in this file is denoted by ### preceding the section name.
# The values in each section are TAB-delimited.
#
# *** Settings section ***
# It contains several settings, which are used to change the flow of the algorithm.
# The possible settings are:
# 	- homosapiens_only: 
#			if only homosapiens products should be queried from uniprot and ensembl # TODO: currently, this is hardcoded into requests so this setting does nothing at the moment
#	- require_product_evidence_codes: 
#			not implemented at the moment
# 	- fisher_test_use_online_query:
#			If True, will query the products of GO Terms (for the num_goterms_products_general inside fisher test) via an online pathway (GOApi.get_goterms).
#			If False, fisher test will compute num_goterms_products_general (= the number of goterms associated with a product) via an offline pathway using GOAF parsing.
#	- include_indirect_annotations:
#			When querying GO terms associated with genes, only specific directly annotated GO Terms are returned (this is a direct annotation).
#			However, all of the parents of a directly annotated GO Term are also indirectly connected to the gene in question (these are indirect annotations).
#
#			Likewise, when computing the number of GO Terms associated with a user-defined pathophysiological process, the GO Terms that the user defines count as direct annotations.
#			However, all the children of the directly annotated GO Terms (indirect annotations) to a pathophysiological process should also count towards the modulation of that pathophysiological process.
#
#			If this setting is set to True, each each GO Term relevant to the analysis will have a list of it's parents and child term ids computed (using go.obo). These ids will be taken
#			into account when performing the fisher exact test. 
#			If this setting is set to False, only directly annotated GO Terms will be accounted for during the scoring process.
#	- uniprotkb_genename_online_query:
#			When querying all genes associated to a GO Term, Gene Ontology returns UniProtKB identified genes (amongst others, such as ZFIN, Xenbase, MGI, RGD).
#			During the algorithm, gene name has to be determined from the UniProtKB id, which is done in (Product).fetch_ortholog_async function.
#			The gene name can be obtained via two pathways:
#				a) online pathway, using: info_dict = await uniprot_api.get_uniprot_info_async(self.id_synonyms[0], session)
#				b) offline pathway, using the GO Annotations File: info_dict = {"genename": goaf.get_uniprotkb_genename(self.id_synonyms[0])}
#			During testing which pathway is more accurate in querying a gene name from a UniProtKB identifier, it was found that querying using the offline pathway (GOAF)
#			resulted in obtaining more valid gene names that an online query to the uniprotkb servers themselves. Therefore, if using the latest GOAF, it is advisable to set
#			this setting to False. If using an older GOAF, then have this setting set to True.
#			If True, will query genename from a UniProtKB id via an online server request.
#			If False, will query genename from a UniProtKB id via the GO Annotations File.
#	- pvalue:
#			Represents the p-value against which the genes will be scored to determine if they are statistically significant. For example, if the VEGFA gene has pvalues smaller than
#			the set pvalue (default is 0.05) for all the processes of interest of the user (eg. cancer+, inflammation+) AND also higher pvalues than the set pvalue for opposite processes
#			(eg. cancer-, inflammation-), then the VEGFA gene is said to be statistically important in the event of coexistance of inflammation and cancer.
#
# *** Processes section ***
# It contains the pathophysiological processes in question to the researcher and the direction of regulation of these processes. For example, if
# a researcher is interested in the genes that positively contribute to both chronic inflammation and cancer, the researcher would construct processes
# section as:
# 	chronic_inflammation	+
#	cancer	+
# The processes are also used in the GO_terms section, to specify how a GO Term contributes to a given process.
#
# *** Categories section ***
# Gene Ontology provides three categories of annotations (as known as Gene Ontology Aspects):
# 	- molecular_activity
#   - biological_process
#   - cellular_component
# The categories section allows you to determine which GO Terms will be queried either from online or from the GO Annotations File.
# For example, when a researcher is only interested in GO Terms related to molecular activity and biological processes, querying GO Terms
# related to a cellular component might result in an incorrect gene scoring process, resulting in some genes being scored as statistically insignificant,
# whereas they should be statistically significant. Thus, a researcher should turn off or on the GO categories according to the research goals.
# To turn on or off a specific GO category, provide a tab-delimited True or False value next to that category.
#
# *** GO_terms section ***
# It contains all of the GO Terms that will be used in the analysis. Each line in the section contains one GO Term,
# with the following tab-delimited values:
#	- [0]: GO Term identifier (eg. GO:0006954)
#   - [1]: process, which the GO Term supposedly regulates (eg. chronic_inflammation)
#   - [2]: positive or negative regulation direction of the process (+ or -)
#   - [3]: weight: the presumed importance of a GO Term in regulating the process. It is used only in the adv_product_score statistical test (a custom implementation of gene importance). If you only intend on using the Fisher's test, the weights are insignificant, just set them to 1.
#   - [4]: GO Term name: the name of the GO Term (optional)
#   - [5]: GO Term description: the description of the GO Term (optional)

# JNK cascade:  evidence indicates that this Janus signaling promotes cancer cell survival. JNK acts synergistically with NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and other signaling molecules to exert a survival function (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/med.21574#:~:text=c%2DJun%20N%2Dterminal%20kinase,to%20exert%20a%20survival%20function)
