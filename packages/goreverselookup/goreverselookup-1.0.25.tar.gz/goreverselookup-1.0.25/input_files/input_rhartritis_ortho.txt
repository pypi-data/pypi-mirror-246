# Each section in this file is denoted by ### preceding the section name.
# The values in each section are TAB-delimited.
#
# *** Evidence code groups section ****
# Contains the whole "tree" of possible evidence codes, attributed to their groups. This section only determines the possible evidence codes groups and specific evidence codes.
# The evidence code groups and specific evidence codes are not set in this section, but rather in the Settings section via the evidence_codes setting.
# This section exists to give user the option to add or exclude any evidence codes, should the GO evidence codes change in the future.
# Each line contains two tab-separated elements:
#	(1) evidence code group name (e.g. author_statement)
#   (2) evidence codes (e.g. TAS,NAS) belonging to the group, along with their ECO identifiers (evidence code and identifier separated by underscore) as comma-separated values (e.g. TAS_ECO:0000304,NAS_ECO:0000303)
#		ECO evidence code identifiers can be found on https://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Guide_to_GO_Evidence_Codes and https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/term/ECO:0000245
# WARNING: the Evidence codes section MUST be specified before the Settings section.
#
# *** Settings section ***
# It contains several settings, which are used to change the flow of the algorithm.
# The possible settings are:
#	- evidence_codes: 
#			Determines which annotations between GO terms and respective genes (vice versa) to accept, based on evidence codes.
#			Based on https://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes/, there are the following 6 evidence groups (noted with belonging evidence codes):
#			  a. experimental evidence (EXP, IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP, HTP, HDA, HMP, HGI, HEP) [experimental]
#			  b. phylogenetically inferred evidence (IBA, IBD, IKR, IRD) [phylogenetic]
#			  c. computational analysis evidence (ISS, ISO, ISA, ISM, IGC, RCA) [computational_analysis]
#			  d. author statement evidence (TAS, NAS) [author_statement]
#			  e. curator statement evidence (IC, ND) [curator_statement]
#			  f. electronic annotation (IEA) [electronic]
#			In the settings, user can choose which evidence codes are valid for the program by specifying evidence groups, and, with the usage of (...) also which exact evidence codes to (or not to) take into account.
#			
#			For example, to take into account all evidence codes belonging to experimental evidence, use a tilde (~)
#				evidence_codes experimental(~)
#			
#			To take into account only specific evidence codes from a group, specify them between the parantheses. If evidence codes
#			are specified among parantheses, all non-specified evidence codes will be excluded. 
#			For example, to take into account only IC, but not ND, from curator_statement, use the following:
#				evidence_codes curator_statement(IC)
#
#			Similarly, you can use an exclamation mark '!' to exclude evidence codes, while retaining the non-specified evidence codes.
#			To exclude only HEP and retain the rest of experimental evidence codes, use:
#				evidence_codes !experimental(HEP)
#
#			By default, if an evidence group is not specified, all belonging evidence codes will still be valid.
#			To exclude evidence codes belonging to a group, do so with an exclamation mark '!'.
#			For example, to exclude entire group of computational analysis evidence codes, use:
#				evidence_codes !computational_analysis(~)
#
#			To merge multiple groups, supply them to the evidence_codes setting as comma-separated-values:
#				evidence_codes experimental(~),phylogenetic(~),computational_analysis(~),author_statement(TAS),curator_statement(IC),!electronic(~)
#
# 	- fisher_test_use_online_query:
#			If True, will query the products of GO Terms (for the num_goterms_products_general inside fisher test) via an online pathway (GOApi.get_goterms).
#			If False, fisher test will compute num_goterms_products_general (= the number of goterms associated with a product) via an offline pathway using GOAF parsing.
#
#	- include_indirect_annotations:
#			When querying GO terms associated with genes, only specific directly annotated GO Terms are returned (this is a direct annotation).
#			However, all of the children of a directly annotated GO Term are also indirectly connected to the gene in question (these are indirect annotations).
#
#			Likewise, when computing the number of GO Terms associated with a user-defined pathophysiological process, the GO Terms that the user defines count as direct annotations.
#			However, all the children of the directly annotated GO Terms (indirect annotations) to a pathophysiological process should also count towards the modulation of that pathophysiological process.
#
#			If this setting is set to True, each each GO Term relevant to the analysis will have a list of it's child term ids computed (using go.obo). These ids will be taken
#			into account when performing the fisher exact test. 
#			If this setting is set to False, only directly annotated GO Terms will be accounted for during the scoring process.
#
#	- uniprotkb_genename_online_query:
#			When querying all genes associated to a GO Term, Gene Ontology returns UniProtKB identified genes (amongst others, such as ZFIN, Xenbase, MGI, RGD).
#			During the algorithm, gene name has to be determined from the UniProtKB id, which is done in (Product).fetch_ortholog_async function.
#			The gene name can be obtained via two pathways:
#				a) online pathway, using: info_dict = await uniprot_api.get_uniprot_info_async(self.id_synonyms[0], session)
#				b) offline pathway, using the GO Annotations File: info_dict = {"genename": goaf.get_uniprotkb_genename(self.id_synonyms[0])}
#			During testing which pathway is more accurate in querying a gene name from a UniProtKB identifier, it was found that querying using the offline pathway (GOAF)
#			resulted in obtaining more valid gene names that an online query to the uniprotkb servers themselves. Therefore, if using the latest GOAF, it is advisable to set
#			this setting to False. If using an older GOAF, then have this setting set to True.
#			If True, will query genename from a UniProtKB id via an online server request.
#			If False, will query genename from a UniProtKB id via the GO Annotations File.
#
#	- pvalue:
#			Represents the p-value against which the genes will be scored to determine if they are statistically significant. For example, if the VEGFA gene has pvalues smaller than
#			the set pvalue (default is 0.05) for all the processes of interest of the user (eg. cancer+, inflammation+) AND also higher pvalues than the set pvalue for opposite processes
#			(eg. cancer-, inflammation-), then the VEGFA gene is said to be statistically important in the event of coexistance of inflammation and cancer.
#
#	- gorth_ortholog_refetch:
#			We implemented a gOrth batch ortholog query (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/orth), which is called using (ReverseLookup).fetch_orthologs_products_batch_gOrth(target_taxon_number=...) function.
#			The function attempts to find orthologs to genes in a single batch request. If 'gorth_ortholog_refetch' is True, then the genes for which orthologs were not found,
#			will be re-fetched using the regular asynchronous ortholog query pipeline. If 'gorth_ortholog_refetch' is False, then the genes for which orthologs were not found will not be queried for orthologs again.
#
#			Warning: For some identifiers, gOrth ortholog query can be inconsistent. For example, consider the MGI id MGI:96824 (Tlr4) (UniProtKB:Q9QUK6): gOrth query from "Mus musculus" to "Homo sapiens" using ENTREZGENE-ACC finds no ortholog for
#			the MGI id (96824), however it finds an ortholog when querying using the UniProtKB id (Q9QUK6) for the same gene. On the other hand, gOrth query for MGI:99512 (Wdr47) (UniProtKB:Q8CGF6) is consistent both for the MGI and for the UniProtKB identifiers.
#			In the default code example, the algorithm attempts to map "3rd party" identifiers (such as ZFIN, RGD, ...) to respective UniProtKB and Ensembl identifiers, prior to executing the gOrth ortholog mappings, since mapping using UniProt or Ensembl ids was shown
#			to be more reliable.
#			
#			For developers: It is highly advisable to call (ReverseLookup).products_perform_idmapping() prior to calling (ReverseLookup).fetch_orthologs_products_batch_gOrth(), so as to map as many "3rd party" ids (RGD, ZFIN, etc) to UniProtKB and Ensembl ids, which
#			are then implicitly used inside fetch_orthologs_products_batch_gOrth() to obtain the best gOrth ortholog mapping results.
#
#	- gorth_ortholog_fetch_for_indefinitive_orthologs
#			The gOrth batch query implementation can return the following options: a) multiple orthologous genes (these are called "indefinitive orthologs"), b) a single orthologous gene (called a "definitive ortholog") or 
#			c) no orthologous genes. In our asynchronos ortholog query pipeline implementation, when multiple orthologous genes are returned from Ensembl, the orthologous gene with the highest percentage identity ("perc_id") is
#			selected as the best ortholog and is assigned as the true ortholog to the input gene. However, gOrth has currently (10_29_2023) no option to return the "best" orthologous gene, neither it has the option to exclude obsolete ortholog gene ids (confirmed by the gProfiler team via an email conversation).
#			Therefore, it is advisable to keep the gorth_ortholog_fetch_for_indefinitive_orthologs to True, so that indefinitive orthologs are discarded from the gOrth ortholog query and are instead fetched by the asynchronos pipeline, which has the ability to 
#			select the best ortholog for the input gene. Having this setting set to False will choose, in the case of "indefinitive orthologs", the first returned ortholog id from the gOrth query, but with no guarantees that this ortholog id is not obsolete.
#
#  - goterm_gene_query_timeout:
#			The timeout (in seconds) after which a goterm gene (product) query will be dropped. GO terms with ~30.000 associated genes take approximately 14 seconds to query.
#			Must be specified as an integer.
#			This setting impacts both synchronous and asynchronous requests. Do note that async requests may take longer than the aforementioned example.
#
#  - goterm_gene_query_max_retries:
#			The maximum amount of request retries for a single GO term gene (product) query
#
#  - exclude_opposite_regulation_direction_check:
#           Determines if, during the gene scoring, both regulation directions (positive or negative) or only a single regulation direction should be accounted for.
#           If True, will check only the direction of regulation for a target process, without taking into account the opposite regulation.
#           For example, if target process is 'angiogenesis+' (stimulation of angiogenesis), and this setting is True, then only the p-values related to
#           'angiogenesis+' will be used (aim: p<0.05), whereas the p-values for the opposite process 'angiogenesis-' (inhibition of angiogenesis) will not be used.
#           If the setting is False, then a product will be statistically significant only if its p-value is less than 0.05 for target process (e.g. 'angiogenesis+') and
#           its p-value for the opposite process greater than 0.05 (e.g. 'angiogenesis-')
#
# *** Processes section ***
# It contains the pathophysiological processes in question to the researcher and the direction of regulation of these processes. For example, if
# a researcher is interested in the genes that positively contribute to both chronic inflammation and cancer, the researcher would construct processes
# section as:
# 	chronic_inflammation	+
#	cancer	+
# The processes are also used in the GO_terms section, to specify how a GO Term contributes to a given process.
#
# *** Categories section ***
# Gene Ontology provides three categories of annotations (as known as Gene Ontology Aspects):
# 	- molecular_activity
#   - biological_process
#   - cellular_component
# The categories section allows you to determine which GO Terms will be queried either from online or from the GO Annotations File.
# For example, when a researcher is only interested in GO Terms related to molecular activity and biological processes, querying GO Terms
# related to a cellular component might result in an incorrect gene scoring process, resulting in some genes being scored as statistically insignificant,
# whereas they should be statistically significant. Thus, a researcher should turn off or on the GO categories according to the research goals.
# To turn on or off a specific GO category, provide a tab-delimited True or False value next to that category.
#
# *** GO_terms section ***
# It contains all of the GO Terms that will be used in the analysis. Each line in the section contains one GO Term,
# with the following tab-delimited values:
#	- [0]: GO Term identifier (eg. GO:0006954)
#   - [1]: process, which the GO Term supposedly regulates (eg. chronic_inflammation)
#   - [2]: positive or negative regulation direction of the process (+ or -)
#   - [3]: weight: the presumed importance of a GO Term in regulating the process. It is used only in the adv_product_score statistical test (a custom implementation of gene importance). If you only intend on using the Fisher's test, the weights are insignificant, just set them to 1.
#   - [4]: GO Term name: the name of the GO Term (optional)
#   - [5]: GO Term description: the description of the GO Term (optional)
