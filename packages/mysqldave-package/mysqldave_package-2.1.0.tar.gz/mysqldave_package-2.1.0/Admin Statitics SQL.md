### Generate stats for a table with Histogram of columns 
A histogram is an approximation of the data distribution for a column. 
It can tell you with a reasonably accuray whether your data is skewed or not, 
which in turn will help the database server understand the nature of data it contains

```sql
-- Generate stats for a table with Histogram of columns
ANALYZE TABLE city UPDATE HISTOGRAM ON Name,District WITH 16 BUCKETS;
```
