### :heavy_plus_sign: Task 2 - creating package on PyPI

Your task is to create your own Python package and publish it on PyPI.  
Read and analyze following steps of publishing package.  
>Think about the job that your package could do!  

Prepare your package in a similar way.  
Make modifications, create newer versions of your package to gain more experience :smiley:


#### **1. Write your Python module and save it under a directory**

#### **2. Create the `setup.py` file with necessary information**

#### **3. Choose a LICENSE and provide a README file for your project**

#### **4. Generate the distribution archives on local machine**

#### **5. Try installing the package on your local machine**

#### **6. Publish the package to the TestPyPi repository to check if all works well**

#### **7. Finally, publish the package to the PyPi repository**
