        Your task is to create your own Python package and publish it on PyPI.  
        Read and analyze following steps of publishing package.  
        >Think about the job that your package could do!  
        
        Prepare your package in a similar way.  
        Make modifications, create newer versions of your package to gain more experience :smiley:
        
        
        #### **1. Write your Python module and save it under a directory**
