# audacity-scripting

A Python wrapper for the [Audacity Scripting Reference](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting_reference.html).

ðŸ“£ **IMPORTANT**: Currently tested only macOS

## Requirements

- Install [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/)
- Audacity - Enable [mod-script-pipe](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting.html)
  - Run Audacity
  - Go into Edit > Preferences > Modules
  - Choose mod-script-pipe (which should show New) and change that to Enabled.
  - Restart Audacity
  - Check that it now does show Enabled.
  - This establishes that Audacity is finding mod-script pipe, and that the version is compatible.

## Getting Started

All the commands assume that the _Audacity_ application is up and running; That is mandatory as we communicate with [_Audacity_'s pipe](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/scripting.html) to execute all the commands.

### Remove spaces between clips

```bash
audacity_scripting clean-spaces --path "/path/to/my_project.aup3"
```

### Send a command to Audacity

```bash
audacity_scripting do-command --command "Select: Track=0 Track=1"
```
