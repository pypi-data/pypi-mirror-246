## Overview
This Python script interacts with the [Tyradex API](https://tyradex.tech/) to retrieve detailed information about Pok√©mon and Pok√©mon types. It is designed to provide easy access to details such as Pok√©dex ID, generation, category, statistics, etc., for individual Pok√©mon or types. The script is organized into classes representing different aspects of Pok√©mon data and includes functions to obtain lists of all Pok√©mon and types.

## Features
