**Promplate** is a prompting framework focusing on developing experience. However, it can also be a super-convenient SDK for simple LLM calls. Promplate progressively enhance your prompting workflow. And it values flexibility as well as perfect conventions. [Learn more](https://docs.promplate.dev/py)

## Installation

```shell
pip install promplate
```

## Development

- use `poetry` to manage dependencies.
- use `isort` to sort import statements.
- use `black` to format code.
- use `pyright` to check type annotations.

## IDE Support ðŸŒ¹

I try to make the syntax compatible with `Jinja2`. So for now I recommend using `Jinja2` highlight settings.

## Future Features (or TODOs?)

- [ ] more documentation
- [ ] javascript implementation
- [ ] error handling
- [x] streaming support
- [ ] more unit tests
- [ ] the order of callbacks matters
