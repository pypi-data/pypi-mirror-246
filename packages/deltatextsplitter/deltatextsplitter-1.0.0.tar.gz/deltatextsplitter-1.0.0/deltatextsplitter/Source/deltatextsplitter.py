class deltatextsplitter:
    """
    This class is the mother-class of the deltatextsplitter-package. It handles
    the comparison of outputs from the pdftextsplitter-package against references.
    These references must be user-provided. The idea is that the user selects a
    certain number of reference-PDF documents (a testset) and provides
    references for those documents; meaning that the user specifies which
    structure elements are supposed to be found.

    The deltatextsplitter then compares these references against the actual
    output of pdftextsplitter and generates a clear KPI of the overall
    performance of pdftextsplitter in text structure recognition.
