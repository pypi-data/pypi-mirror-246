File HeavyWater_Soper.h5 is the measured data from Soper(2013).
To get figure 8 and figure 9 in the paper Prompt, please follow the steps:
1. Run ./runHW.sh to get data of the simulation with non-biased heavy water sample. 
2. Change the materialref of the volume Sample in total_scattering.gdml from 'HeavyWater' to 'HeavyWater_biased'.
3. Change the particle number of runHW.sh from 4e8 to 4e7.
4. Run ./runHW.sh again to get data of the simulation with biased heavy water sample.
5. Run python plot.py
