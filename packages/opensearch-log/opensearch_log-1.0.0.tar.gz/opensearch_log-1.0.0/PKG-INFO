# opensearch-log

opensearch-log is a Python logging handler for direct and efficient log transmission to
OpenSearch.

It integrates with Python's standard logging framework to send logs to an OpenSearch
cluster, offering a blend of efficiency, reliability, and ease of use.

Also includes a specialized logging formatter that enables stdout logs to be
formatted  in JSON.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Logging**: Designed for minimal impact on application performance.
- **Reliable Transmission**: Ensures consistent delivery of logs to OpenSearch.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup with Python's standard logging system.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adaptable to various logging and OpenSearch setups.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Handles log transmission asynchronously for enhanced performance.

Ideal for applications ranging from small-scale projects to large enterprise systems,
OpenSearchLogHandler provides a robust and straightforward solution for managing logs
with OpenSearch.
