# FusionX - A deep learning pipeline for cell-cell fusion analysis
Leveraging the capabilities of deep learning, we employ advanced techniques to generate a csv file with the number of nuclei per cell as well as masked images.
FusionX is the solution giving statistics to the Fusion community.
By uploading membrane and nuclei channel, you can get both the masks as well as the CSV file.
